# Python OOP Tutorial---Classes and Instances

This document contains my notes from [Corey Schafer's YouTube tutorials(https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc).

## 1. Classes and instances

Why use classes? They logically group our data (attributes) and functions (methods) in a way that is easy to use, resue, and build upon.

A class is a blueprint for creating instances. Instance variables contain data that are unique to each instance. In the code, "emp_1" will be passed in as self and then the __init__ will set all of the attributes.

See part 01 of the code.

## 2. Class variables

Create a method (function) within our class to create "first last" name.

See part 02 of the code.

## 3. classmethods and staticmethods

TBD

## 4. Inheritance---creating subclasses

TBD

## 5. Special--Magic--Dunder methods

TBD

## 6. Property decorators---getters, setters, and deleters
