% Python OOP tutorial---classes and instances

Why use classes? They logically group our data (attributes) and functions (methods) in a way that is easy to use, resue, and build upon.

A class is a blueprint for creating instances. Instance variables contain data that are unique to each instance. In the code, "emp_1" will be passed in as self and then the __init__ will set all of the attributes.
